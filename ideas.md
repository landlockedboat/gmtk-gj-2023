## Initial Idea (DONE)

* Animal crossing but you are tom nook
  * Could work like a papers please
    * Not enjoyable playing or developing
    * A lot of UI
  * Action movement repair simulator
    * Not enjoyable creating
    * Limited interest in movement action
* Roguelike but you're the dungeon
  * Classic idea, probably lots of ppl will be doing the same
  * I would like to build this
  * I enjoy creating games with RPG elements
  * Dont know if i would enjoy the result for myself, not really wholesome
  * Does it align with my values?
  * I dont know if i should care that much about "integrity" or whatever when building games tbh
  * I do tend to censor myself a lot
  * I can still shine through whatever i'm building and embue my game of unique little things
  * Maybe i just enjoy creating this kinds of games and that's it!
